# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - 2026-11-06

### Added

- ASCII skull loaders: a symmetric skull drawn in text characters, generated
  at any size by `src/utils/asciiSkull.js` and rendered by the new
  `AsciiSkull` / `MicroSkull` UI components (presets block, large, medium,
  small; eyes that look around and blink, closed, or crossed out).
- Opening an incident shows the block skull with the real download progress
  (percentage and megabytes, from the response's Content-Length) and a Cancel
  button that returns to no incident.
- `EmptyState` accepts an `illustration` in place of its icon.

### Changed

- Loading a tab, a failed incident load (eyes crossed out), the "no active
  incident" state (asleep) and file parsing in the upload zones now use the
  skull; connecting, loading the incident list, an unreachable server and
  busy buttons (backup export/restore, API key creation, incident export) use
  the inline micro skull.
- Skulls stay still when the operating system asks to reduce motion.

### Removed

- The `Spinner` UI component, replaced everywhere by the skulls.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-11-04

### Added

- Several profiles per browser (Chrome "Default", "Profile 1", "Work", …):
  add, rename and delete them in Browser Forensics; each profile has its own
  files and data, and the browser badge sums all profiles.
- Timeline and flags name the profile ("Chrome · Work") when a browser has
  more than one; flags on a deleted profile are kept and marked as such.
- `profile` query parameter on `POST /api/incidents/{id}/upload` (profile
  name, case-insensitive, created if missing; default `Default`) and a
  `profile` argument on the Cortex XSOAR `nik-upload-artifact` command.
- Alembic migration `0003_browser_profiles`, moving existing browser data
  into a "Default" profile.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** an incident's browser data is now
  `data.browser.browsers[<id>] = { activeProfile, profiles: { <profileId>:
  { id, name, createdAt, history, downloads, bookmarks, shortcuts, meta } } }`
  instead of the artifact lists directly under `browsers[<id>]`. API clients
  reading `data.browser` must follow the new shape.
- **BREAKING:** the upload response `target` is now
  `browser/<id>/<profile>/<source>` and includes `profileId`.
- Path hints show `<profile>` in place of the Chromium/Firefox profile folder.
- Incident exports are envelope version 4; versions 3 and older still import.
- Creating, patching, fetching and restoring incidents convert any pre-2.0.0
  browser data, so old exports, backups and clients keep working.

### Upgrade notes

Back up, then run `alembic upgrade head` (automatic in the Docker image): the
migration rewrites every incident once, which can take a while on large
databases.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-11-04

### Added

- Safari in Browser Forensics (macOS only): `History.db` (browsing history
  with redirect chains), `Downloads.plist` and `Bookmarks.plist` (Favorites,
  folders and Reading List, with the date each item was added).
- A dependency-free property list parser for the browser, reading both binary
  (`bplist00`) and XML plists.
- Browser registry `platforms` field: the "where to find files" note warns
  when a browser does not exist on the incident's host OS.
- Safari uploads through the REST API (`browser=safari`, `source` =
  `history` / `downloads` / `bookmarks`).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-11-04

### Added

- `GET /api/incidents/{id}` answers `304 Not Modified` to a matching
  `If-None-Match`, checking only the version column (not the document body).
- `PATCH /api/incidents/{id}` accepts `Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json`
  (RFC 7396): nested members are merged and `null` removes one, so a client
  can send only what changed. Plain `application/json` keeps its behaviour.
- `os` in the `view=summary` incident listing, stored in a new `incidents.os`
  column (Alembic migration `0002_incident_os_column` backfills it).
- Frontend unit tests on Node's built-in test runner (`npm test`), run in CI.

### Changed

- Opening Nik downloads only the light incident list. An incident's artifacts
  are fetched when it is opened, behind a non-blocking loading state (the
  sidebar stays usable; switching incident cancels the pending download), and
  stay cached for the session with ETag revalidation on reopen.
- Every edit (flags, notes, uploads, metadata) sends only the changed part of
  the incident as a merge patch instead of the whole `data` blob.
- Exporting an incident that was not opened yet fetches it first.

### Fixed

- The backend test fixture resets the rate limiter between tests, so the
  login limit no longer makes the suite fail as it grows.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-07-11

### Added

- First release of Nik: forensic analysis platform with browser, command
  history and endpoint artifact analysis, a super-timeline, SOC detection
  rules, case management, full backup, authentication and audit, and the
  external REST API.
